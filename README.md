This project analyzes hate crime data from the FBI's Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program between 2021 and 2023. The goal is to identify trends in hate crimes across different states and categories, understand the patterns of those committing these crimes, and pinpoint areas where interventions are most needed.

The analysis provides valuable insights for:

Law Enforcement: To better allocate resources and focus on high-incident areas.

Policy Makers: To create more effective prevention strategies based on data-driven trends.

Community Organizations: To develop targeted initiatives and support affected communities.

The primary dataset, by_state_hate_crimes.csv, was created by merging and cleaning the annual FBI Hate Crime Statistics reports. The Jupyter Notebook finalZR.ipynb contains the Python code for the complete analysis, including data cleaning, outlier removal, and visualization of hate crime distributions.

To get started, you can run the Jupyter Notebook to see the full analysis and visualizations. The notebook uses pandas, seaborn, and matplotlib for data manipulation and plotting. The original data can be found at the UCR Crime Data Explorer, or the zip folder containing all spreadsheets used. Or, simply click on the file in this repository named "finalZR.ipynb"
